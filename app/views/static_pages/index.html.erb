      <hr>
      <p>
        In 1939 a Norwegian engineer Ole Bardahl developed a revolutionary lubrication principle, based on a polarization phenomenon. Prior to Bardahl, lubricants were weak, molecular-attraction based formulas that breakdown during uses. <span class="highlight">Bardahlâ€™s polar attraction formula allows lubricants to maintain an anti-friction, anti-wear and extreme pressure</span> microscopic film insulating every moving metal part in any mechanical system. The product was and is still revolutionary that the American Army decided to keep it as a defense secret till the end of the War .Soon after the War concluded Bardahl was being sold internationally to the finest mechanics and auto enthusiasts. Bardahl delivers championship-level products and protection in every product.

        Bardahl is often tested in every day usage .The 
        most challenging and hardest on engines is the 
        demanding NO-Oil-RUN. This test consists of 
        adding Bardahl to an engine, letting it run for 
        only a few minutes, draining the oil out of the 
        engine completely and then driving a distance of 
        more than 1300 km about (900) +miles. At the end of the test, the engine is completely dismantled and inspected for wear and tear. Bardahl's proven technology protects engine even under these conditions. Completed in several countries including America, Malaysia, Argentina and most recently Italy in a large 18 wheel truck, this test proves Bardahl's long lasting protection of the most critical metal components found in an engine.
